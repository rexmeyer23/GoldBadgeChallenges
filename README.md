# GoldBadgeChallenges
This was the final project required to finish Gold Badge at Eleven Fifty Academy. Each challenge consisted of a class library, a console application, and a unit test to ensure all methods in the repository were working properly.
The repo held the class properties and constructors and employed CRUD methods that were to be used in the Program UI. This project was created using C# in the .NET framework in visual studio IDE.
#Installation
Open the project with visual studio code. 
# ChallengeOne - Cafe
This application allows the user to modify the komodo cafe menu by creating new menu items and removing old ones from the list. Creating a new item requires the user to input the name, ingredients, item description, 
and item price along with an ID number.

# ChallengeTwo - Claims
This application was created so an insurance agent can modify a claim by entering a claim ID number, the claim type, a description for the claim, a claim amount, the date of the accident, and it detects whether or not
the claim is valid by maksing sure the claim was made before the 30 day expiration date. The agent can then add a claim to a list, see a list of claims, and take care of a claim by selecting the first item in a queue.

# ChallengeThree - Badges
This application maintains a dictionary of detais requirng an employee's badge information. Each badge has an ID number, a list of accessible doors, and a name. The user can list all badges with their information, 
edit a badge's door access, and add a badge to the list.

# ChallengeFour - Outings
Still in the works.
